# 🚀 Startup Investment Translator & Success Predictor

This project is part of the final assignment for the Data Analytics Bootcamp. The goal is to create a solution that helps startup employees without a financial background understand the context and terminology of investment rounds. The project includes an educational "translation manual", a predictive model to estimate startup success, a Power BI dashboard, and a deployed Streamlit app.

## 🎯 Objective

1. Build a "translation manual" that simplifies investment terms and startup lifecycle phases.
2. Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key relationships between variables such as funding, country, industry, and status.
3. Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of startup success.
4. Create an interactive Power BI dashboard.
5. Deploy a user-friendly app in Streamlit.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Power BI
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub


## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Includes visualizations and descriptive stats for:
- Investment rounds by country
- Relationship between total funding and success
- Success rates by industry
- Startup status distribution (operating, closed, acquired...)

## 🧪 Modeling

We built a classification model to predict startup success using:
- Total funding
- Country
- Status
- Industry

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion matrix

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard allows users to:
- Filter startups by country or status
- See average investment by industry
- Compare status distribution across regions
- Discover trending industries

## 🌐 Streamlit App

The app includes:
- A simple educational section for financial concepts
- Startup success prediction based on user inputs
- Visualizations from the EDA
